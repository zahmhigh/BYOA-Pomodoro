## Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a timer to break work into focused intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

### Basic Workflow:
1. **Focus Session**: Work for 25 minutes without interruption
2. **Short Break**: Take a 5-minute break
3. **Repeat**: After 4 focus sessions, take a longer 15-minute break

## Browser Compatibility
